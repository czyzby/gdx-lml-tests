<!-- Image text buttons are extended text buttons
    with an internal Image. Additionally to any
    button, table and label attributes, they can
    also have image attributes, which will be
    applied to their internal icon. -->

<imageTextButton>Hello.</imageTextButton>

<container size=128>
    <imageTextButton image="default-round-down">
        Bigger button.
    </imageTextButton>
</container>

<!-- Since buttons extend table, they can have any
    children. Contrary to regular image buttons,
    they append text between tags to their original
    label, rather than creating a new one for each
    line. -->

<imageTextButton text="Initial." multiline=true>
    This will be also
    appended to button text.
    No new labels are created.
    <mock row=true/>
    <!-- Adding colspan=2, as internal image and
        label are also in cells. --> 
    <label color="green" colspan=2>
        This is a separate label.
    </label>
</imageTextButton>
